# Concentration Response Modelling Training Material
The repository contains code and worked examples to demonstrate the estimation of no-effect toxicity estimates from concentration response data.

# No- effects toxicity estimation
estimation of no-effect concentrations for substances of concern are integral to both risk assessment regulation and for the establishment of environmental quality standards.

A range of new statistical approaches are being developed and/or adopted in ecotoxicology, that when combined, have the potential to greatly improve the estimation of no-effect toxicity values from Concentration-Response (CR) experimental data.
This course will cover the most recent methods for estimating toxicity (and more specifically no-effect toxicity) from concentration response models using R. 
The course will begin with an introduction to CR modelling, including: the difference between linear, non-linear and threshold models; natural scaling of response variables (endpoints) and generalised modelling; and the distinction between derived toxicity metrics (NEC, ECx). We will then introduce a new metric for estimating no-effect toxicity (the NSEC). Finally, we will demonstrate the application of CR models and the estimation of toxicity values in R, using frequentist approaches via the drc package, and within a Bayesian framework using the backage bayesnec. Finally, we will discuss and demonstrate the advantages of using the model averaging framework for toxicity estimating using CR data.
